# MatLight: A light linear algebra library.

Supporting most commonly used linear algebra operations like getting rank and determinant of matrix, **SVD**, **pseudo-inverse**, etc.

I've searched around npm and github for handy JavaScript linear algebra libraries for my web based robotics simulation project but surprisingly found nothing meets my requirements. So why not build my own!

To make it easier to maintain and update, I chose TypeScript for this project. By default if you install this package from npm you'll get the compiled version which should be able to work with es5.

## Quick start

comming soon...
